ABSTRACT
The StudentCafe Token (SCT) project is a pioneering initiative aimed at revolutionizing the campus experience by leveraging blockchain technology.  introduces a token-based system that empowers students to assist each other with an extra motivation leading to extra deserts or even full meals upon a voucher system design.
StudentCafe Token (SCT) tokens serve two primary functions: as digital redeem voucher for campus dining and as a means for students to gift tokens to their peers. 
The project emphasizes security with measures to protect tokens from theft and loss. Additionally, privacy features are incorporated to discourage coercion.
Through StudentCafe Token (SCT), students can enjoy a simplified and secure means of dining while creating a vibrant and caring campus environment. 
StudentCafe Token (SCT) embodies more than just a means of exchange; it symbolizes the strength of student community spirit, promoting a new era of student interactions and collaboration.

Introduction 

Education is not just about academics; it's also about creating a supportive and enriching campus environment. The SudentCafe Token project seeks to promote a sense of community and enhance the campus dining experience for students. This innovative approach allows students to support one another in accessing delicious desserts and meals at the school's cafeteria through the use of tokens, fostering a culture of mutual assistance and camaraderie.
The goal of the project is to:
 Enable students to assist each other in accessing meals and desserts at the school cafeteria.
 Standardize and promote the token-based system, ensuring widespread adoption across the campus.
 Address security concerns related to token transactions and wallet protection

Problem Statement:

Traditional financial transactions and the lack of a standardized system for peer-to-peer support pose challenges for students in accessing meals and desserts at the school cafeteria. There's a need for a secure, simplified, and community-driven solution to enable students to assist each other while enhancing the campus dining experience.  StudentCafe Token (SCT) project aims to tackle these challenges by implementing a token-driven system that promotes mutual assistance and simplifies transactions among the student community. This eliminates the necessity for cash, which can potentially give rise to social issues or compromises. The token is intricately linked to the school's ecosystem, making it significantly more equitable and secure in the recommended use cases.

SOLUTION
StudentCafe Token (SCT) project offers an innovative solution to empower students in accessing campus meals and desserts. By introducing a secure and standardized token-based system, StudentCafe Token (SCT) enables students to support each other seamlessly. 
StudentCafe Token (SCT) not only simplifies interaction but also creates a community-driven atmosphere of mutual assistance and camaraderie. 
This solution redefines campus dining, enhancing the student experience and fostering a sense of shared responsibility and unity among students.
Furthermore, additional ideas can be designed to maintain the utility features of the StudentCafe Token (SCT) project. Here's how each idea can align with the utility aspects:
Student can use StudentCafe Token SCT for bonuses introduced by the cafeteria for specific offers.

StudentCafe Token (SCT) tokens can be rewarded to student as educational rewards for academic achievements

StudentCafe Token (SCT) tokens can be rewarded to student giving feedback on how to improve StudentCafe Token utility ensuring that the project remains aligned with the needs of the student community.

StudentCafe Token (SCT) can grant students access to campus events or provide exclusive discounts for event tickets. 

Students who hold StudentCafe Token (SCT) tokens could enjoy special privileges, such as discounted entry to concerts, sports events, workshops, or cultural festivals held on campus.

Token Name
StudentCafe Token 
The platform name “StudentCafe Token”, is a suitable and relevant name for the proposed capstone project platform.
SCT's primary purpose is to simplify and secure the process of accessing meals and desserts at the school cafeteria while fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility among students 


Token Ticker
SCT
As students presenting our group capstone project, we have decided to use the token ticker “SCT". The acronym stands for “StudentCafe Token". 


TOKEN MAXIMUM SUPPLY
100, 000, 000, 000 SCT
A supply of one hundred billion StudentCafe Tokens (SCT) is justified as it enables the project to reach a large and diverse audience effectively. This sizable token supply ensures scalability and accessibility, making SCT available to a broad user base. It accommodates microtransactions, supports various use cases, and allows for the implementation of rewards and incentives to encourage engagement. With a substantial token supply, the project can scale its operations, adapt to changing demands, and distribute tokens equitably, ultimately enhancing its ability to reach and serve a large audience.

TOKEN SLOGAN
"Fostering Community and Campus Dining”


The slogan for the SCT token encapsulates the core value proposition and purpose of the token. The slogan "Fostering Community and Campus Dining" succinctly conveys the essence of the Student Cafe Token (SCT) project. it aims to nurture a sense of community and togetherness among students. It also emphasizes the importance of enhancing the overall campus dining experience, making it not just about meals but a vital part of the campus community. This slogan encapsulates the project's commitment to creating a more inclusive and enjoyable campus environment through its innovative token system.


TOKEN LOGO
The logo's elements contain a hexagon that depicts unity, sharing, and community. At the top of the hexagon is the graduation cap, which is not just a traditional attire, but a symbol of pride, achievement, and success for the student community.
